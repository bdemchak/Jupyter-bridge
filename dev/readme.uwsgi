This was helpful in getting the uwsgi connected to nginx, but don't take it too literally, as:
1) The user name in directories needs to be changed to my name
2) There is a typo (`) at the end of the ExecStart line in the myproject.service file
3) For installing wheel, uwsgi, and flask, it looks like the pip should be pip3?

Remember, also, to install redis and requests
Remember to use project name jupyter-bridge (and jupyter-bridge-env) instead of myproject (and myprojectenv)
